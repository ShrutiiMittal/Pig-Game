# Pig-Game
A javascript based small game where two players can compete against each other through dice rolls to get a score of 100. It's based on DOM manipulation and the use of callback functions and event listeners.

# Rules
A user rolls a dice .If it's 1, then the player is switched and the current score is lost. If it's any number other than 1, then the user can either continue playing and the score adds to the current score or else hold up which adds the current score to the total score. Between the two players, whoever scores a total of 100 or more first wins the game.
